Modeling canopy and socio-economic change in the Chicago Region

The urban forest is not equitably distributed. In the Chicago region, census block groups earning the top fifth of median income have 10% more canopy than those in the bottom fifth. This pattern is observed across many cities, and while the consequences of this inequity are the subject of abundant social, medical, and ecological research, its origins are poorly understood. Trees are slow growing, and the consequences of urban forest planning and management have decades or even centuries long legacies on tree canopy distribution. This talk will explore historical patterns of wealth and tree canopy in the Chicago region over the last 200 years. It will examine whether wealthy people chose to settle in sites that already had trees, or if trees were planted after their arrival. The urban canopy we see today is the result of historical interactions between complex social and environmental forces. Many cities are actively working to increase tree canopy overall, while ensuring that underserved populations receive the many benefits that trees provide. Improved understanding of the forces that shape the urban canopy could strengthen such efforts.
